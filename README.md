# Python-loop-and-list
I have written this code for my python class where I learned how to create a list such as a line called "food_truck" and "type_of_food"
I have learned about creating a list where I can list many items in a single variable. Also, I learned how to include user input where a user can input their favorite dish/meal and the type of food.
My assignments were completed on Google Drive by relying on the feature called "Google Colaboratory". My original file is on my Google Drive: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KxZAaUlAWkc5-VgCPxy4h_meCr5WLtJz?usp=sharing
